# EE676A_PDSCH_chain
In this simulation of E2E transceiver design of PDSCH chain was implemented using Matlab.
– The implemented blocks during transmission of PDSCH data with large random generation of binary data are cyclic redundancy check,code block segmentation,LDPC encoding,Rate matching,Interleaver,code block concatenation,Scrambler
and QPSK modulation.
– After adding minimal noise ,then similarly same blocks are implemented which have opposite functionality at the
receiver.
